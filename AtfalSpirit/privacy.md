# AtfalSpirit Privacy Policy

## User Data Collection and Usage

AtfalSpirit is a mobile application designed for parents to track academic activities for Atfal (boys aged 7-15). To use the app, parents/guardians are required to register by providing the following details:

- First Name
- Last Name
- Aim ID (given to every member of the Ahmadiyya Association in the UK)
- Email
- Password

Once registered, parents/guardians can add details for their Atfal, including first name, last name, Aim ID, and optional email and contact information.

### Data Collected
The app allows parents to track Salat (Muslim prayer) offerings for each Atfal. The scoring system is as follows:
- Score 1: Salat offered at home
- Score 2: Salat offered at the mosque

### Leaderboard
A public leaderboard displays the combined scores of Atfal, showing their full names (first name + last name).

## Aim ID and Data Sharing

Aim ID is collected for member identification, ensuring only members of the Ahmadiyya Association can use the app. All user data can be shared with the Ahmadiyya Association upon demand.

## Data Retention

User data is retained until Atfal reach the age of 15. Future releases will include a data removal feature. Data can also be removed on demand.

## Policy Changes

As of now, there is no process to inform users about policy changes. This feature will be added in future releases.

For any inquiries or requests, please contact [nottingham@atfal.co.uk](mailto:nottingham@atfal.co.uk).
